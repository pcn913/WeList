  <h2>Accessing and Modifying Personal Information and Communication Preferences</h2>

  <p>If you have provided Personal Information in creating an account to use our Service, you may review and make changes to your Personal Information by e-mailing us at support@WeList.io. In addition, you may manage your receipt of marketing and non-transactional communications by clicking on the "unsubscribe" link located on the bottom of any WeList marketing e-mail.

You should be aware, however, that it is not always possible to completely remove or modify information in our subscription databases.</p>

  <h2>How We Use and Share the Information</h2>

  <p>We use the Personal Information and the Other Information to provide you with the Service, to solicit your feedback, to inform you about our products and our Service, and to improve our Service for you. Also, we may share Personal Information and/or Other Information as described below.</p>

  <p>In an ongoing effort to better understand our users and our Website and the Service, we might analyze your Personal Information and Other Information in aggregate form in order to operate, maintain, manage, and improve the Website and the Service. This aggregate information does not identify you personally. We may share this aggregate data with our affiliates, agents, and business partners. We may also disclose aggregated user statistics in order to describe our products and services to current and prospective business partners and to other third parties for other lawful purposes.</p>

  <p>We may employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples may include providing marketing assistance, order fulfillment, billing, payment processing, and customer service. These other companies will have access to the Personal Information and the Other Information only as necessary to perform their functions and to the extent permitted by law.</p>

  <p>As we develop our businesses, we might sell or buy businesses or assets. In the event of a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, sale of assets, dissolution, or similar event, the Personal Information and Other Information may be part of the transferred assets.</p>

  <p>To the extent permitted by law, we may also disclose Personal Information and the Other Information when required by law, court order, or other government or law enforcement authority or regulatory agency, or whenever we believe that disclosing such information is necessary or advisable, for example, to protect the rights, property, or safety of WeList or others.</p>

  <h2>How We Protect Your Information</h2>

  <p>We take reasonable steps to protect the Personal Information and the Other Information from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. Please understand, however, that no security system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the security of our databases, nor can we guarantee that the information you supply will not be intercepted while being transmitted to and from us over the Internet. In particular, e-mail sent to or from the Website may not be secure, and you should therefore take special care in deciding what information you send to us via e-mail.</p>

  <h2>Important Notice to Non-U.S. Residents</h2>

  <p>We do not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under the age of 13 through the Website or the Service. If you are under 13, please do not give us any Personal Information. We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children's Internet usage and to help enforce our Privacy Policy by instructing their children to never provide us Personal Information without their permission. If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 13 has provided Personal Information to us, please contact us, and we will endeavor to delete that Personal Information from our databases.</p>
