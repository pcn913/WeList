    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>

    <p>Effective as of June 3, 2017</p>

    <p>WeList ("WeList," "we," "us," or "our") welcomes you. Thank you for choosing to access and use our service (the "Service") made available to you through our website located at http://welist.io (the "Website") or through our mobile application (the "App").</p>

    <p>We provide access to and use of our Service subject to the following terms of service (the "Terms of Service"), which are effective as of the date stated above. By using the Service, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be legally bound by the terms and conditions of these Terms of Service and the terms and conditions of our Privacy Policy, which is hereby incorporated by reference. Please take the time to review our Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to any terms in these Terms of Service or the Privacy Policy, then please do not use our Service.</p>

    <p>We may change these Terms of Service from time to time, and will post any changes on the Website or notify you via email, at our option, as soon as such changes are in effect. By continuing to use the Service after we make any such changes to the Terms of Service, you are deemed to have accepted such changes. Please refer back to these Terms of Service on a regular basis.</p>

    <h2>Access and Use</h2>

    <p>Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, WeList will provide access to and use of the Service to you (“User”). You are solely responsible for any data or content uploaded or stored on the Service ("User Data"). In no event shall WeList be responsible for the use or misuse of any User Data by User or other third party. As User, you warrant and represent that you either own or have the right to provide all User Data. You hereby grant WeList a non-exclusive, transferable, royalty-free license to use the User Data to provide the Service and as otherwise described in herein or in our Privacy Policy.</p>

    <p>All right, title, and interest in and to the Service, the Website, the App, and any information, data, software, graphics, and interactive features contained therein, including all modifications, improvements, adaptations, enhancements, or translations made thereto, and all proprietary rights in any of the foregoing (collectively, "WeList Property"), shall be and remain the sole and exclusive property of WeList.</p>

    <p>User will not, and will not permit any other third party to: (i) allow anyone other than User to access or use the Service; (ii) use the Service in any way that is not expressly permitted by this Agreement, including, without limitation, reverse engineering, modifying, copying, distributing, or sublicensing the Service, or introducing into the Service any software, virus, or code; or (iii) use the Service in violation of any applicable law or regulation.</p>

    <h2>Registration</h2>

    <p>Prior to using the Service, User will be required to register for an account. During the registration process, User will select logon credentials. Logon credentials can only be used by the User to whom they are assigned and cannot be shared among Users or with third parties. User is solely responsible for the confidentiality and use of all logon credentials for its account, as well as for any use or misuse of the Service using User's logon credentials. User shall notify us immediately if you become aware of any loss, theft or unauthorized use of any logon credentials, and we reserve the right to delete or change them at any time and for any reason.</p>

    <h2>Term and Termination</h2>

    <p>WeList may suspend or terminate your access to and use of the Service, in whole or in part, at any time and for any reason. You may terminate your account at any time upon notice to us. In the event of suspension or termination, you will not be able to access the User Data, and WeList will delete the User Data, although residual copies of information may remain in our system for some time for back-up purposes. It is your responsibility to keep backup copies of the User Data; WeList will have no responsibility for retaining the User Data or for providing you with access to or copies of the User Data in the event of any suspension or termination as described above.</p>

    <h2>DISCLAIMERS; LIMITED WARRANTY</h2>

    <p>THE WELIST PROPERTY IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE," AND WELIST DOES NOT MAKE ANY WARRANTIES WITH RESPECT TO THE SAME OR OTHERWISE IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS OF SERVICE AND HEREBY DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AVAILABILITY, ERROR-FREE OR UNINTERRUPTED OPERATION, AND ANY WARRANTIES ARISING FROM A COURSE OF DEALING, COURSE OF PERFORMANCE, OR USAGE OF TRADE. TO THE EXTENT THAT WELIST MAY NOT AS A MATTER OF APPLICABLE LAW DISCLAIM ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY, THE SCOPE AND DURATION OF SUCH WARRANTY WILL BE THE MINIMUM PERMITTED UNDER SUCH LAW.</p>

    <h2>LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h2>

    <p>IN NO EVENT WILL WELIST BE LIABLE TO USER OR ANY OTHER PARTY, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES OF ANY KIND ARISING FROM OR RELATING TO THE WELIST PROPERTY OR OTHERWISE RELATING TO THESE TERMS OF SERVICE, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER WELIST WAS ADVISED, HAD OTHER REASON TO KNOW, OR IN FACT KNEW OF THE POSSIBILITY THEREOF.</p>

    <h2>Indemnification</h2>

    <p>User will defend, indemnify, and hold harmless WeList and its officers, directors, managers, and employees from any and all liabilities, costs, and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees) in connection with any third-party claim that any of the User Data: (i) infringes or misappropriates any third-party intellectual property rights, privacy or publicity rights, or any other rights; or (ii) violates any applicable laws, rules, or regulations. WeList shall promptly notify User of the claim, provided, however, that failure to provide such notice shall not relieve User of its indemnity obligations unless it is materially prejudiced thereby. User shall have control over the defense of the claim, provided that (i) User does not make any admission of liability on behalf of WeList or agree to any settlement that imposes a financial burden on WeList without WeList's prior written consent; and (ii) WeList shall have the right to participate in the defense of any such claim, at its own cost, with counsel of its choice.</p>

    <h2>General Provisions</h2>

    <p>User shall not assign these Terms of Service or any of its rights hereunder without the prior, written consent of WeList. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties hereto and their permitted successors and assigns. These Terms of Service and performance hereunder shall be construed and governed by the laws of the State of Illinois without giving effect to conflicts of laws principles. The parties consent and agree that any and all litigation between them arising from these Terms of Service or the business relationship created hereby shall take place in the state or federal courts located in Chicago, Illinois. Each Party irrevocably consents and submits to the jurisdiction and venue of any such courts. If any provision of these Terms of Service is deemed invalid or unenforceable, it shall be amended or replaced in the way that best reflects the original intention of the parties, and the remainder of these Terms of Service shall remain in full force and effect. These Terms of Service, together with the Privacy Policy and any pricing information made known to you at registration, constitute the final and complete agreement between the parties regarding the subject matter hereof, and supersedes any prior or contemporaneous communications, representations, or agreements between the parties, whether oral or written.</p>
